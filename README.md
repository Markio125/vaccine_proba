# vaccine_proba
This was a task given through Geeks for Geeks under the IITG summer analytics workshop, where I had to analyze various features of a dataset and make a model that predicts the likelihood of a person taking two specific vaccines, expressed in probabilities.

My final submission file will be submission_SVM.csv as the SVM model I made gave better results than the Logistic Regression model, but that file has also been included in both my code and as a csv file to show my thought process while working on this project.
